# The project name is YoursToDo to manage your ToDo items.
Simple WPF and WinUI application with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.
This is a simple project to manage ToDo items list created in WPF and latest WinUI 3.

if you are looking to work on WinUI 3. If you are looking to migrate the existing WPF app into WinUI 3. I believe This sample will help you figure out the
differences between WPF and WinUI including code changes and UI prespective.

Thsi sample has below things:
1) WPF Application in .Net 7.0
2) WinUI 3 Application in .Net 7.0
3) C# version 11.0
4) EF Core 7.0 Code First approach to create a database in SQL Server
5) Package CommunityToolkit.Mvvm as MVVM.Light is now obsolute.
6) Solid Principles
